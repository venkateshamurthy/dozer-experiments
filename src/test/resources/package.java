 * Change Log
 * ===============================================================================
 * Date				Description
 * ---------		---------------------------------------------------------------
 * July-2015		Added beans.xml which contain all constant converters and example objects.
 * 					Used bean-default.properties to cut-short the repeating package names in the class field of bean definition
 * 					Used to set system properties(have also added logging.properties) for java.util.Logger to format the log lines to my taste
 * 					Added dozerBeanMapping.xml to capture the example object conversions of different types.
